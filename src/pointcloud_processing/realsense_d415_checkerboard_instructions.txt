CHECKERBOARD CALIBRATION PATTERN - PRINTING INSTRUCTIONS
======================================================

Pattern Specifications:
  - Pattern size: 8x10 squares
  - Square size: 35 mm (3.5 cm)
  - Total dimensions: 350x280 mm (35.0x28.0 cm)
  - Inner corners for detection: 7x9

Printing Instructions:
  1. Print at 100% scale (no scaling)
  2. Use a laser printer for best contrast
  3. Print on matte paper to reduce reflections
  4. Mount on rigid backing (foam core or cardboard)
  5. Verify square size with a ruler after printing

Calibration Parameters for OpenCV/Python:
  square_size = 0.035  # Square size in meters
  pattern_size = (7, 9)  # Inner corners

Calibration Parameters for MATLAB:
  checkerboardParams.squareSize = 0.035;  %% Square size in meters
  checkerboardParams.patternSize = [7, 9];  %% Inner corners

Quality Check:
  - Measure several squares with a caliper
  - All squares should be exactly 35 mm
  - Pattern should be perfectly flat when mounted
