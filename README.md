# 6-axis-Manipulator-Kinematics
The objective of this repo is to create a general environment which let the user simulate in Matlab a general 6 DoF manipulator (for now UR5 and ABB IRb-7600) by plotting the links and the relative frames. The repo includes the computation of Direct, Inverse, and Inverse Differential Kinematics, together with trajectory-generation functions.
